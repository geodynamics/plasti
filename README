Plasti is a 2-D ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) code donated to
CIG by Sean Willett and Chris Fuller of the University of
Washington. The code was based on work by Philippe Fullsack at
Dalhousie University in Canada.

The code is described in greater detail in the paper

  Fuller, C.W., Willett, S.D. and Brandon, M.T., 2006. Formation of
  forearc basins and their influence on subduction zone
  earthquakes. Geology, 34: 65-68.

To compile Plasti, you need a Fortran 90 compiler and lapack and blas
implementations.  The code has been tested with gfortran (4.0 and 4.1)
and g95, and was originally developed with the Absoft compiler.

The makefile is set up to compile with gfortran, so you may have to
modify it if you want to use a different compiler.  gfortan gives a
number of warnings about common blocks, but should compile fine.

Included with the code is a sample input file "meshin_oly".  The file
has extensive comments.  When plasti reads the input file, it expects
the comment lines interspersed with the input parameters.  So do not
increase or decrease the number of lines of comments.  Also, the input
file must be named "meshin_oly".

To get results, first run meshg_oly to create the mesh and then
plasti_oly to actually run the simulation.  So if you are using
gfortran, the entire sequence of commands would be

  $ make
  $ ./meshg_oly
  $ ./plasti_oly

meshg_oly will create some files in the input/ and profiles/
directories.  It should complete in a few seconds.  plasti_oly will
create files in the output/ directory.  It should finish the first
step in less than a minute, but the entire run will take hours.  The
code outputs every 100 time steps, and it should take about ten minutes
to get to step 100.

If, for example, you wish to look at the xx component of the stress as
a function of the coordinates, coord_1, coord_2, coord_3, etc. has the
coordinates for that time step, and stress_xx_1 has the stress at
those coordinates.
